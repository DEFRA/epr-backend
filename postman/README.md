# Postman collection to be used for testing the API

The Postman collection can be imported into Postman for testing.

Note that for requests that require a request body, refer to the `Body` section on Postman to find the right fixture to use.

There are also some environment variables that can be set (dev and test)

New restrictions apply when testing the API on a lower environment via your local machine. You will need to generate a `x-api-key` and set the value in the environment variables in Postman. Documentation on how to do so can be found [here](https://portal.cdp-int.defra.cloud/documentation/how-to/developer-api-key.md)
