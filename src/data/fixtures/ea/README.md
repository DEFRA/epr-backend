# Overview

The data in this directory is generated by

1. Submitting data from forms in test env
2. Open CDP terminal for test env
3. Logging into mongo shell and export data from relevant collection e.g.
   `print(EJSON.stringify(db.organisation.findOne({orgId:503152}, null, 2)))`

They are meant to be used for developing and testing parsing of data submitted through forms.

## Syncing with production forms

Based on manually browsing through all questions across 20 forms in PROD, haven't noticed any difference between regional versions of the forms.

Only there were differences between TEST and PROD EA forms.

TEST env forms were synced with production on `2025-10-08`.

### Sync process

1. Download JSON files from production defra forms designer for EA forms
2. Create directory: `mkdir -p prod_forms_download`
3. Place downloaded JSON files in `prod_forms_download/`
4. Run the script: `./update-defra-prod-forms.sh prod_forms_download`
5. If successful, [upload the updated files to TEST env](https://forms-designer.test.cdp-int.defra.cloud/library?sort=updatedDesc&title=PEPR&author=all)

> [!WARNING]
> Never upload production JSON files directly to test without URL replacement. They will submit data to the production epr-backend API.
